2. My study life

    Cmpetetion is fierce in SUFE. Library is always full of people everyday. Teachers are really good. They can magically change hard and boring courses interesting.  I love all my core courses, and I always feel grateful towards my professors for both the knowledge they taught and the virtual role they played.

3. My good friends

    Apart from good grades and knowledge, the most important thing I harvest from university is a bunch of good friends. We have thoughts and ideas that could be shared and disccused a lot. We help each other in classes, in jobs, and also we played an important role in each others' future plan.
