## In this page, I will test the performance of the following three bond investment stategies. 

1. Buy and Hold - Buy the 5 year bond and hold to maturity (so hold it for 5years) and then buy a new 5-year bond and repeat;

2. Riding the Yield Curve - Buy the 5 yr bond, hold for one year then sell when it has 4 years left to maturity, buy another 5 year bond, repeat;

3. Bond Ladder - Start by investing 20% of your wealth in bonds of each maturity. At the end of the first year, when the 1 year bond matures,invest the proceeds in a new 5 year bond, repeat.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r load-libraries, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)

```

### write a function to get price information
```{r}
return_price <- function(year1 = t, period = N){
  col_name <- paste('y_', period, sep = "")
  price <- bond_price %>%
    filter(year == year1)
  price1 <- price[,col_name]
  result <- as.numeric(price1)
  return(result)
  }
```

### import data, only select data in June
```{r}
bond_price <- read_xlsx('../../data/MFA_Dataset.xlsx', sheet = 'Price of zero coupon bonds')
bond_price <- bond_price %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date),
         month = month(date)) %>% 
  filter(month == 6)

```

### glimpse of data
```{r}
glimpse(bond_price)
```


### Strategy a
```{r }
mat <- matrix(nrow = 100, ncol = 2) # set a new dataframe to store value
net <- 100
year_now = 1952
mat[1,] <- c(1952, 100)
price_buy <- return_price(year = year_now, period = 5) # get the 5-year bond price at year 1952
num <- net / price_buy

for (i in 1:65){
  year_now <- year_now + 1
  if(i %% 5 == 0 ){
    net <- 100 * num  #get the principal of 100 at maturity
    price_buy <- return_price(year = year_now, period = 5)
    num <- net / price_buy  
    mat[i+1,] <- c(year_now, net)
  } 
  else{
    year_buy <- return_price(year = year_now, period = 5 - i %% 5) # get the current price of our holding bond
    net <- year_buy * num
    mat[i+1,] <- c(year_now, net)
  }
}

mat_1 <- data.frame(mat) %>% 
  rename(year = X1,
         strategy1 = X2) %>% 
  drop_na()

```

### strategy b
```{r }
mat <- matrix(nrow = 100, ncol = 2) # set a new dataframe to store value
net <- 100
year_now = 1952
mat[1,] <- c(1952, 100)

for (i in 1:65){
  year_now <- year_now + 1
  year_buy = year_now - 1
  price_buy = return_price(year = year_buy, period = 5) # our cost to buy the old bond last year
  price_sell = return_price(year = year_now, period = 4) #the price we sell for our old bond
  earning = price_sell - price_buy # profit earned from one unit of bond
  num <- net / price_buy  
  net <- net + earning * num
  mat[i+1,] <- c(year_now, net)
  } 
 

mat_2 <- data.frame(mat) %>% 
  rename(year = X1,
         strategy2 = X2) %>% 
  drop_na()

```

### strategy c

```{r }
mat <- matrix(nrow = 100, ncol = 2) # set a new dataframe to store value
net <- 100
year_now = 1952
mat[1,] <- c(1952, 100)
price_buy_1 <- return_price(year = year_now, period = 1) 
price_buy_2 <- return_price(year = year_now, period = 2)
price_buy_3 <- return_price(year = year_now, period = 3)
price_buy_4 <- return_price(year = year_now, period = 4)
price_buy_5 <- return_price(year = year_now, period = 5)
num_1 <- net * 0.2 / price_buy_1
num_2 <- net * 0.2 / price_buy_2
num_3 <- net * 0.2 / price_buy_3
num_4 <- net * 0.2 / price_buy_4
num_5 <- net * 0.2 / price_buy_5

for (i in 1:65){
  year_now <- year_now + 1
  year_buy = year_now - 1
  proceed <- 100 * num_1 #proceeds we get from year 1 bond matured
  price_buy_1 <- return_price(year = year_buy, period = 1)
  price_buy_2 <- return_price(year = year_buy, period = 2)
  price_buy_3 <- return_price(year = year_buy, period = 3)
  price_buy_4 <- return_price(year = year_buy, period = 4)
  price_buy_5 <- return_price(year = year_now, period = 5) # market price now
  num_1 <- num_2
  num_2 <- num_3
  num_3 <- num_4
  num_4 <- num_5
  num_5 <- proceed / price_buy_5
  net <- price_buy_1 * num_1 + price_buy_2 * num_2 + price_buy_3 * num_3 + price_buy_4 * num_4 + price_buy_5 * num_5 # value of the fund
  mat[i+1,] <- c(year_now, net)

  } 

mat_3 <- data.frame(mat) %>% 
  rename(year = X1,
         strategy3 = X2) %>% 
  drop_na()

```

### Result

```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
data <- left_join(mat_2, mat_3, by = 'year')
data <- left_join(data, mat_1, by = 'year') %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:4, names_to = 'strategy', values_to = 'net_value')
data2 <- pivot_wider(data, names_from = strategy, values_from = net_value)


data %>% ggplot(aes( x = year, y = net_value, color = strategy)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = 'back test for three bonds strategies',
       y = 'portfolio total value')
```


```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
data %>% ggplot(aes( x = year, y = net_value, color = 'strategy') ) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = 'none') +
  facet_wrap(~strategy)+

       y = 'portfolio value' )    
```

### Conclusion

1. For strategy 1, its Macaulay duration changes with changes in time to maturity. Its duration goes from 5 to 1 periodically within 5 years. Therefore, the average Macaulay duration of strategy 1 for the whole 65 years is 3 years. 

2. For strategy 2, this strategy always holds a bond that has 5 years to maturity. So, the Macaulay duration for Strategy 2 is 5 years.

3. For strategy 3, for the very beginning, this strategy allocates its weight to each bond evenly. So, it has a Macaulay duration of 3 years equal to that of Strategy 1. However, its Macaulay duration changes over time. The weight on bonds with different terms changes because firstly they perform differently, and secondly with time going by, their duration naturally decreases with maturity decreases. So approximately, the Macaulay duration for Strategy 3 is shorter than strategy 2.
Also, Strategy 3 has the smallest standard deviation. This is because it holds diversified bonds, which could partly diversified interest risks and provide higher liquidity. These reasons explain why strategy 3 has a smaller standard deviation than strategy 1.

All in all, by logic, Strategy 2 should have a larger Macaulay duration, and Strategy 1 and Strategy 3 should have a similar Macaulay duration. This is also the truth in empirical data of Standard deviation, where Strategy 2 shows a higher standard deviation, and Strategy 1 and Strategy 3 have a smaller standard deviation.
