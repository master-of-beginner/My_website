# London Business School

1. My feelings

    It is really nice to be here. Teachers here are really good. They are knowlegeable as well as humble. I keeps learning things every day. The feeling of tasting new things, meeting new friends, experiencing new cultures is amazing.

2. My life here at London

    London  Business School provides me with a wonderful life experience. The school is very beautiful, like a fairy tale. I have made good friends there. Also, the scenery in the Thames is wonderful. London Tower, London Bridge, and Canary Wharlf are especially amazing at sunset and night.
