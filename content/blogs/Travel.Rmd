#  The university is infinite, and the exploration is endless

I have been to lots of places. I rode on prairies, climbed the highest mountains in my country and camped under stars. There are so many good memories in travel.

I once watched a video from TED Speech, where there was a saying really touching me. 

> Travel really transformed me, making me realize the difference between making a living and make life. "YOUNG = GO". You are living a mement in your life where you have more freedom and flexibility than you may ever have before.
